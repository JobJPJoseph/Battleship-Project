# Battleship Project

We will make a CLI version a battleship game.
However, like the CLI `Tic-Tak-Toe Project`, we are going to further
implement more of what we learned. In some cases it may not make sense to do so but
that isnt the goal to make a perfect working code.

Things to implement:
    Inheritance: Done
    Binding (context)
    Asychronousity (Promises/asyce-await): Done
    Error Handling: Done
    NPM Packages (Mocha/Chai)
    Class instances: Done
